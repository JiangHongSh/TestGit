Chuck Schumer Calls On Rick Scott To Recuse Himself From Florida's Recounts</h2><p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) on Sunday urged Gov. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) to recuse himself from recount procedures in Florida following midterm elections that resulted in three tight races ― including one in which Scott is a candidate.</p><p>Schumer suggested any role Scott would play as governor in the recounts represents a major conflict of interest, given that he is challenging Democratic incumbent Bill Nelson in the Senate race that is one of those still up in the air. Unofficial returns give Scott a razor-thin lead. </p><p>“Scott should recuse himself immediately,” Schumer said on CNN’s “State Of The Union.” “He has a self-interest in jaundicing this election. He should be out of it all together.”</p><p>Schumer says Republican Gov. Rick Scott should recuse himself immediately from the recount procedures in Florida: “He has a self-interest in jaundicing this election.

Cory Gardner (R-Colo.), during an appearance Sunday on NBC’s “Meet The Press,” said he understood Scott’s “frustration.”</p><p>“We have evidence that the state constitution of Florida was violated,” said Gardner, who headed the GOP Senate campaign arm in this election cycle. “A court in Florida has said that. We have evidence that people were going into unwitnessed areas filling out ballots, duplicating ballots, which is allowed under the law but only if you have witnesses on the canvassing board.”</p><p>“I think he’s right to be upset,” Gardner said of Scott. “Now what we have to do, though, is make sure that we are protecting the integrity of this election. That we count every vote, that we count every ballot, that we make sure the integrity of this election is as strong as it can be.” </p><p>WATCH: Sen.

Fox News Host Responds To Ocasio-Cortez After Being Called Out For Money-Shaming Her</h2><p></p><p>Fox News anchor Ed Henry responded to Democratic Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on Saturday, addressing her criticism that he’d made fun of her financial situation Friday on Fox’s “America’s Newsroom.”</p><p>Ocasio-Cortez admitted in a New York Times profile that she can’t afford to move to Washington, D.C., before her new congressional salary kicks in.</p><p>Henry said that the New Yorker is often seen doing photo shoots in “multi-thousand-dollar outfits, which could pay a month’s rent in D.C.” Ocasio-Cortez responded to Henry via twitter, saying that she “never purchased pricey clothes.”</p><p>1. @FoxNews, why can’t any of your anchors say my name correctly? It’s been 5 months.2. It is bizarre to see 1%-salaried anchors laugh at the US housing crisis.3. Never purchased pricey clothes + always told my story. But repeating lies until they are believed is your thing. https://t.co/Py5aXFi3Z4</p><p>“Look, I get it,” Henry responded during “Fox & Friends” on Saturday morning. “I live in Washington. It’s very expensive. ... Members of Congress make $174,000 a year. That’s a lot more than people around the country.”</p><p>Henry said he does believe there is a housing crisis in America and invited Ocasio-Cortez to come on the network and discuss the issue. </p><p>“Let’s talk about that issue,” Henry said. “You are a congresswoman now, or are going to be very soon. Come on Fox.”</p><p>You can watch Henry’s full comments in the video above.</p><img src="https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Fq07rVpvW_neeURxQB3w2Q--~A/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODQ7aD04NDtpbD1wbGFuZQ--/http://l.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/GLB/2017-06-07/710c91c0-4b9c-11e7-8912-374be9390b1b_H-1-.png.cf.jpg"></img><img src="https://s.yimg.com/nn/lib/metro/DailyFantasy_BN_Baseball_300x250-min.jpg"></img></div></div></body></html>

Netanyahu calls Paris conversation with Putin 'very important'</h2><p>PARIS (Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin at World War One commemorations on Sunday, their first meeting since the downing of a Russian plane during an Israeli air raid in Syria in September.</p><p>"The conversation with President Putin was good and businesslike. I would even describe it as very important," Netanyahu told reporters after the ceremony in Paris, adding that he also spoke there with U.S. President Donald Trump.</p><p>Moscow said last month it had delivered S-300 surface-to-air missiles to Syria, where Israel has struck Iranian targets.</p><p>The missile shipment came after Russia, a main backer of the Damascus government, accused Israel of indirectly causing the downing of a Russian military jet by Syrian air defenses following an Israeli air strike nearby.</p><p>Netanyahu, speaking to reporters on Sunday, also said he favored reaching an "arrangement" that would avoid an all out war with Gaza and stave off a deepening humanitarian crisis.</p><p>On Friday, Israel allowed $15 million of Qatari cash to enter the Gaza Strip, which is controlled by the Islamist Hamas movement. Egypt, Qatar and the United Nations have been trying to broker a long-term cease fire between Hamas and Israel.</p><p>(Writing by Dan Williams.

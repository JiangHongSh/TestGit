We have no agenda but to love," they wrote.</p><p>"Like many people, we have had to reflect on our beliefs," the founders wrote. "It's a long and continuing journey."</p><p>Photographer Lara Hotz, who shot three covers for the magazine, told media in August that it wasn't including gay couples - though it hadn't said so publicly.</p><p>Ms Hotz, who is in a same-sex marriage herself, said the magazine's decision made her feel "extremely hurt".</p><p>"It appears they are happy to take money, content and photographs from LGBTQI advertisers and contributors, but are yet to support and represent us in the same way as heterosexual couples are represented in the magazine," radio programme Hack quoted her as saying.</p><p>The photographer said she did not want to force the magazine to include same-sex weddings, but felt its stance should be made transparent.</p><p>We've written a statement and shared a bit of our story, which we've posted on our website. We'd love to invite you to read it.</p><p>End of Facebook post  by White Magazine</p><p>A Facebook post by White drew a mixed response, with some praising the founders for sticking to their principles, and others branding them homophobes who did not deserve to be in business. </p><p>"It doesn't seem to me that your agenda is just to love, it seems like your agenda is just to love straight people," wrote Ruth Parker.</p><p>Another commenter, Cynthia McKenzie, said she felt the magazine's freedom of speech had been impeded, writing: "Unfortunately today if you have faith and don't agree with same-sex marriage, you can't run your own business the way you want."</p><p>White magazine is not the first enterprise to shut after a diversity row. Last month, an Oregon bakery that had refused to make a wedding cake for a lesbian couple closed down for good.</p><p>The PM says next week will be "critical" and that progress in talks on the UK-EU future relationship could win over Tory rebels.</p><p>15 sayings from around the world</p><img src="https://sa.bbc.co.uk/bbc/bbc/s?name=news.world.australia.story.46254385.page&ml_name=webmodule&ml_version=-1&blq_e=orbit&blq_r=orbit&blq_s=orbit&blq_v=default&language=en&pal_route=asset&language=en-GB&pal_webapp=tabloid&prod_name=news&app_name=news&cps_asset_id=46254385&page_type=StoryÂ§ion=%2Fnews%2Fworld%2Faustralia&first_pub=2018-11-18T13%3A16%3A20%2B00%3A00&last_editorial_update=2018-11-18T15%3A46%3A29%2B00%3A00&curie=95b025ef-4735-8e47-9822-7b1aa9c451df&title=Australian+wedding+magazine+White+shuts+after+LGBT+row&has_video=&topic_names=Australia%21Same-sex+marriage%21LGBT&topic_ids=czv6rjvdy9gt%21cjxv139mm9xt%21cp7r8vgln2wt&for_nation=us&app_version=1.264.1&app_type=responsive&bbc_site=news&blq_js_enabled=0"></img><img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/10EB2/production/_104389296_wedding.jpg"></img><img src="//ssc.api.bbc.com/?c1=2&c2=19293874&ns_site=bbc&name="></img></div></div></body></html>

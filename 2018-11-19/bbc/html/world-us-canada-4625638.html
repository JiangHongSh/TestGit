US mid-terms: Rick Scott wins contested Florida Senate race</h2><p></p><p>Share this with</p><p>Email</p><p>Facebook</p><p>Messenger</p><p>Messenger</p><p>Twitter</p><p>Pinterest</p><p>WhatsApp</p><p>LinkedIn</p><p>Copy this link</p><p>These are external links and will open in a new window</p><p>Florida's outgoing Republican Governor Rick Scott has declared victory in a contested Senate race in the state.</p><p>The vote was subject to a recount after his lead in the 6 November ballot fell to less than 0.5%.</p><p>The final result showed Mr Scott beat three-term incumbent Democrat Senator Bill Nelson by just more than 10,000 votes from the 8.19m cast state-wide.</p><p>Republicans, including the president, had alleged voter fraud in the race and Democrats alleged voter suppression. </p><p>Lawyers representing Senator Nelson's campaign also launched legal challenges to support the recount effort, but he eventually conceded on Sunday afternoon. </p><p>Florida is a notorious US swing state and has a history of marginal election victories, so the knife-edge result was not a major surprise.</p><p>The tight and well-publicised race evoked memories of Florida's infamous 2000 presidential recount, which ended only after intervention from the US Supreme Court. </p><p>In a statement on his Facebook page on Sunday almost two weeks on, Mr Scott confirmed his opponent had conceded.</p><p>"I just spoke with Senator Bill Nelson, who graciously conceded, and I thanked him for his years of public service," the statement said.</p><p>He concluded the message, following the protracted counting process, with: "Let's get to work."</p><p>In a tweet, President Trump congratulated Senator-elect Scott on his victory. </p><p>In the Senate race, unofficial results revealed Mr Scott was leading Mr Nelson by just 0.15%.</p><p>Mr Scott, who claimed victory on election night, had reacted angrily to the recount, hitting out at "unethical liberals" who were trying to "steal" the election.</p><p>Mr Nelson accused Mr Scott of making "false claims" about voter fraud because he was "afraid of losing".</p><p>Florida's governor race was also subject to a recount. </p><p>Democrat Andrew Gillum conceded - and then withdrew his concession - after Ron DeSantis' lead for the Republicans narrowed to 0.41% in that race.</p><p>Gillum, who hoped to be Florida's first black governor, eventually conceded defeat for the second time on Saturday.</p><p>Much like in the Senate race, both candidates disagreed strongly about the need for a recount and there were protests on both sides.</p><p>Mr Scott's victory does not change things substantially, but consolidates the Republican Senate majority. They have 52 seats to the Democrats' 47 seats with only a Mississippi run-off still to go. </p><p>Mr Scott's election will be a stark change for Florida where Mr Nelson, 72, has been a fixture in politics since he was first elected to the state legislature in 1972 and then to the US Senate in 2000.</p><p>Mr Scott has already served two terms as Florida's governor - the maximum allowed by state law.</p><p>He was elected in 2010 and 2014, and before that worked in business within the US healthcare sector.</p><p>He invested $40m of his own fortune into the contest, making it one of the most expensive Senate races in US history.</p><p>The PM says next week will be "critical" and that progress in talks on the UK-EU future relationship could win over Tory rebels.</p><p>15 sayings from around the world</p><img src="https://sa.bbc.co.uk/bbc/bbc/s?name=news.world.us_and_canada.story.46256389.page&ml_name=webmodule&ml_version=-1&blq_e=orbit&blq_r=orbit&blq_s=orbit&blq_v=default&language=en&pal_route=asset&language=en-GB&pal_webapp=tabloid&prod_name=news&app_name=news&cps_asset_id=46256389&page_type=StoryÂ§ion=%2Fnews%2Fworld%2Fus_and_canada&first_pub=2018-11-18T20%3A57%3A37%2B00%3A00&last_editorial_update=2018-11-18T21%3A30%3A25%2B00%3A00&curie=35bb1eca-c4ab-4845-9b28-caee30950008&title=US+mid-terms%3A+Rick+Scott+wins+contested+Florida+Senate+race&has_video=&topic_names=US+mid-terms+2018%21Florida&topic_ids=cwm11216mzyt%21c77jz3mdq1jt&for_nation=us&app_version=1.264.1&app_type=responsive&bbc_site=news&blq_js_enabled=0"></img><img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/E0B9/production/_104392575_fa38728f-81ba-4c89-89da-0b40d3002096.jpg"></img><img src="//ssc.api.bbc.com/?c1=2&c2=19293874&ns_site=bbc&name="></img></div></div></body></html>

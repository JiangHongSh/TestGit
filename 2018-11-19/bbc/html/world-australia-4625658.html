Last week, US media reported officials were preparing charges against him.</p><p>Earlier this month Ms Anderson, a former Baywatch star and long-time advocate for Mr Assange, had called on the Australian government to help him.</p><p>"Get Julian his passport back and take him back home to Australian and be proud of him, and throw him a parade when he gets home," she told Australia's 60 Minutes programme.</p><p>Mr Morrison's comment was made soon afterwards on a radio programme. He also reiterated Australia's position that it would not intervene in Mr Assange's case.</p><p>On Sunday, Ms Anderson wrote in an open letter: "You trivialized and laughed about the suffering of an Australian and his family.</p><p>"You followed it with smutty, unnecessary comments about a woman voicing her political opinion."</p><p>Several Australian politicians backed her criticism of Mr Morrison's language, even if some disputed her views on Mr Assange's case.</p><p>Labor Senator Kristina Keneally tweeted: "It's high time men, including @ScottMorrisonMP, stopped using a woman's sexuality & appearance to denigrate her political arguments."</p><p>Independent Senator Derryn Hinch add that Mr Morrison "really should not have said it".</p><p>One government minister, Steve Ciobo, told Australian media: "I suspect it was a statement that was said in a light-hearted way".</p><p>The PM says next week will be "critical" and that progress in talks on the UK-EU future relationship could win over Tory rebels.</p><p>15 sayings from around the world</p><img src="https://sa.bbc.co.uk/bbc/bbc/s?name=news.world.australia.story.46256585.page&ml_name=webmodule&ml_version=-1&blq_e=orbit&blq_r=orbit&blq_s=orbit&blq_v=default&language=en&pal_route=asset&language=en-GB&pal_webapp=tabloid&prod_name=news&app_name=news&cps_asset_id=46256585&page_type=StoryÂ§ion=%2Fnews%2Fworld%2Faustralia&first_pub=2018-11-18T21%3A40%3A58%2B00%3A00&last_editorial_update=2018-11-19T02%3A04%3A40%2B00%3A00&curie=2fc2eb4d-46c4-ff4a-bdb9-3add96cd9843&title=Pamela+Anderson+criticises+Australia+PM+for+%27smutty%27+comment&has_video=&topic_names=Australia%21Wikileaks%21Scott+Morrison%21Julian+Assange&topic_ids=czv6rjvdy9gt%21cr5pde3rxpvt%21czlml1pl1qqt%21c82wm9yvv05t&for_nation=us&app_version=1.264.1&app_type=responsive&bbc_site=news&blq_js_enabled=0"></img><img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/EE6F/production/_104393016_gettyimages-936679660.jpg"></img><img src="//ssc.api.bbc.com/?c1=2&c2=19293874&ns_site=bbc&name="></img></div></div></body></html>

They are causing crime and big problems in Mexico. Go home!"</p><p>The anti-migrant feeling could also be seen on the streets of Tijuana.</p><p>"They are invaders! They are armed! Get out of the country," protesters shouted, according to Reuters news agency.</p><p>Esther Monroy, 58, told AFP news agency she feared the numbers of migrants gathering in the city would lead to the US closing the border crossing,</p><p>"Most of us in this depend on business from people coming and going across the border," she said.</p><p>"If they close it, it will be [the migrants'] fault." </p><p>"If the government can't control all this, organised crime and drug cartels will," America Villa added. "We don't care who does it, but they have to take responsibility for these people."</p><p>However, not everyone was protesting against the migrants. A smaller demonstration was also held in support of the new arrivals, who say they are fleeing persecution, poverty and violence in their home countries of Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador.</p><p>And there was even understanding from the migrants themselves.</p><p>"They have the right to protest because they don't like that we're here but in spite of everything, they [Mexicans] are good people," Karina Rosales, a migrant from Honduras, told Reuters. </p><p>"They are the same as us. But we're only passing through. We won't stay here." </p><p>The PM says next week will be "critical" and that progress in talks on the UK-EU future relationship could win over Tory rebels.</p><p>15 sayings from around the world</p><img src="https://sa.bbc.co.uk/bbc/bbc/s?name=news.world.latin_america.story.46256878.page&ml_name=webmodule&ml_version=-1&blq_e=orbit&blq_r=orbit&blq_s=orbit&blq_v=default&language=en&pal_route=asset&language=en-GB&pal_webapp=tabloid&prod_name=news&app_name=news&cps_asset_id=46256878&page_type=StoryÂ§ion=%2Fnews%2Fworld%2Flatin_america&first_pub=2018-11-19T04%3A10%3A33%2B00%3A00&last_editorial_update=2018-11-19T04%3A28%3A55%2B00%3A00&curie=9de52727-ab57-c646-85d1-8458049d833f&title=Migrant+caravan%3A+Mexican+border+city+Tijuana+protests+arrival&has_video=1&topic_names=Refugees+and+asylum+seekers%21Mexico%21United+States%21California%21Migrant+caravan&topic_ids=cg41ylwvxmdt%21crr7mlg0vr2t%21cx1m7zg01xyt%21cz4pr2gd5mzt%21cpz748kpzp8t&for_nation=us&app_version=1.264.1&app_type=responsive&bbc_site=news&blq_js_enabled=0"></img><img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/720x405/p06s615n.jpg"></img><img src="//ssc.api.bbc.com/?c1=2&c2=19293874&ns_site=bbc&name="></img></div></div></body></html>
